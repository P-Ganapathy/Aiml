</p>The region was called Kongunadu ruled by semi-independent chieftains who owed nominal allegiance to the Chera kingdom and Kongu kings. Large quantities of Roman coins and other artifacts discovered in the region attest to the presence of Roman traders. The Coimbatore region is in the middle of the "Roman trail" that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu.[5][6] At the end of the Sangam period, the region became a part of the Western Ganga kingdom.[7][8][9]The Medieval Cholas conquered the region in the 9th century CE. They constructed a highway called "Rajakesari Peruvazhi".[10][11] During the 9th century CE, Coimbatore was ruled by Irula chief Kovan or Covan during whose reign the city of Coimbatore was constructed, allegedly at the behest of a Chera king who accompanied Sundarar on a pilgrimage to the Patteswarar Temple, Perur.[12] Following the decline of the Cholas, Coimbatore was ruled for brief periods by the Pandyas,.[13]
Anglo-Mysore Wars and Polygar Wars (1768-1802 CE)Coimbatore was coveted by the Mysore sultans as well as British troops during the Anglo-Mysore Wars.[14] The city was taken by the forces of the British East India Company in 1768 but were forced to abandon it due to treachery.[14] Colonel Fullarton occupied the city in 1783 but later returned to Tipu Sultan as per the Treaty of Mangalore.[14] At the beginning of the Third Mysore War, Coimbatore was, once again, taken by the British.[14] Tipu Sultan besieged the city twice and repulsed in the first, he was successful in the second and Coimbatore surrendered in October 1791. The commanders of the garrison, Lieutenant Chalmers and Lieutenant Nash were taken as prisoners to Seringapatnam.[14] Coimbatore fell to the British at the end of the Third Mysore War but was restored to Tipu Sultan at the cessation of hostilities.[14] Coimbatore was eventually annexed by the British on the defeat and death of Tipu Sultan in 1799. Coimbatore was taken by the Polygars in 1800 and was an important stronghold in the Polygar Wars. It was made capital of Coimbatore district in 1865.[14]
